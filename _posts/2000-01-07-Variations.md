We want to assume that one of the islanders is **color-blind**. Then there are two situations:
 <font size=6 color=black>1. The color-blinded person has <font size=6 color=brown>brown</font> eyes:</font>

If the color-blinded person has blue eyes, he will be not able to see the eye colors of anyone else. It does not bother the deduction of two blue-eyed people. So just like the normal situation, the two blue-eyed people will leave at **Day 2**.

<font size=6 color=black>2. The color-blinded person has <font size=6 color=blue>blue</font> eyes and more than one blue-eyed islander:</font>

If the color-blinded person has blue eyes, he will be not able to see the eye colors of anyone else. Hence he will not be able to know own eye color based on the announcement or the behavior of others. He will stay on the island indefinitely.

The normal blue-eyed person will see one blue-eyed and three brown-eyed people. His deduction will be like: "If that person is the only one with blue eyes, then I have brown eyes. That case, he will leave the island tonight. If not, then that means I also have blue eyes, and we both have to leave tomorrow night." On the **Day 1**, no one leaves.It is because the blue-eyed person is waiting for the other one to leave. On the **Day 2**, he sees that the other blue-eyed person is still on the island, so he realizes that he has blue eyes too. Therefore, the normal blue-eyed person leaves at midnight on the **Day 2**.

All of brown-eyed people will see two blue-eyed and two brown-eyed people. Their deduction will be like: "If those two people are the only ones with blue eyes, then I have brown eyes. That case, they will leave the island tomorrow night. If not, it means there are more than two people with blue eyes." On the Day 1, no one leaves. Each brown-eyed person is waiting for the two blue-eyed people to leave. On the **Day 2**, they see only one of the blue-eyed people has left, while the other one is still on the island. Now they will feel quite confused, as it contradicts their assumption. Therefore they will not be able to figure out their own eye color or why the other blue-eyed person is still on the island.

In this variation, only the normal blue-eyed person will leave the island at the midnight of**Day 2**. The other four people will stay on the island forever.

Therefore in general, if there are more than one blue-eyed people (suppose the total number is **m**), the normal blue-eyed people will leave the island at the midnight of **Day m**. 
<font size=6 color=black>3. The color-blinded person is the only islander who has <font size=6 color=blue>blue</font> eyes:</font>

In this situation, all the other islanders will see one blue-eyed person and the rest are brown-eyed. As the blue-eyed person cannot deduct his own eye color based on the behavior of others, he will wait till the last day and find there is no one left hence he realize he is the blue-eyed person. Then he will leave at the midnight.
