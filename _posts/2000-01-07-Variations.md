We want to assume that one of the islanders is **color-blind**. Suppose the total people is four. Then there are three situations:
 <font size=6 color=black>1. The color-blinded person has <font size=6 color=brown>brown</font> eyes:</font>

If the color-blinded person has blue eyes, he will be not able to see the eye colors of anyone else. It does not bother the deduction of two blue-eyed people. So just like the normal situation, all the **m** blue-eyed people will suicide at **Day m**.

<font size=6 color=black>2. The color-blinded person has <font size=6 color=blue>blue</font> eyes and more than one blue-eyed islanders:</font>

Suppose there are three blue-eyed people. If the color-blinded person has blue eyes, he will be not able to see the eye colors of anyone else. Hence he will not be able to know own eye color based on the announcement or the behavior of others. He will stay on the island indefinitely.

The normal blue-eyed person will see two blue-eyed and one brown-eyed people. His deduction will be like: "If those two is the only two with blue eyes, then I have brown eyes. That case, they will suicide the island the midnight of Day 2. If not, then that means I also have blue eyes, and we have to suicide the midnight of **Day 3**." On the Day 1 and Day 2 no one suicides.It is because the blue-eyed person is waiting for the other one to suicide. On the Day 3, he sees that the other blue-eyed person is still on the island, so he realizes that he has blue eyes too. Therefore, the two normal blue-eyed person suicides at midnight on the **Day 3**.

The brown-eyed people will see three blue-eyed. His deduction will be like: "If those three people are the only ones with blue eyes, then I have brown eyes. That case, they will suicide the midnight of Day 3. If not, it means there are more than three people with blue eyes and I am one of them" On the Day 1 and Day 2, no one suicides. On the Day 3, he see only two of the three blue-eyed people has left, while the other one is still on the island. Now he will feel quite confused, as it contradicts his assumption. Therefore they will not be able to figure out their own eye color or why the other blue-eyed person is still on the island.

The Kriple model of this typical variation is shown in **Fig. 5-9** from before the announcement to **Day 3**.

Therefore in general, if there are more than one blue-eyed people (suppose the total number is **m**), all the normal blue-eyed people (**m-1**) will suicide the island at the midnight of **Day m**, the color-blinded one will stay on the island.

<font size=6 color=black>3. The color-blinded person is the only islander who has <font size=6 color=blue>blue</font> eyes:</font>

We still set the total number of islanders to 4. In this situation, all the three brown islanders will see one blue-eyed person and two brown-eyed. They will think " if he does not suicide on **Day 1** then I should be in blue-eyed. " However, since the blue-eyed person cannot deduct his own eye color based on the behavior of others, he will not suicide on Day 1. On the **Day 2**, the brown-eyed people see the only blue-eyed person has not left, they will mistakenly think they have blue eyes and suicide the island suicide **Day 2**. The color-blinded blue-eyed person sees them suicide and and realize he is blue-eyed. Therefore he will suicide on **Day 2**.
