<font size=6>Kripke model</font>
Initially, we can draw the following <strong>Kripke model (with m=4)</strong>: (From top to down, left to right). **1** represents **blue-eyed** and **0** represents **brown-eyed**. We assume that there are two brown-eyed people and two blue-eyed people. In Fig.1, it is the situation that the foreigner has not made the announcement. None of the islanders can determine the color of their own eyes. But they can determine the color of other islanders' eyes. So each islander's knowledge includes the color of the other islanders' eyes, as well as both blue and brown as possible colors for their own eyes. So each islander incorporates two possible worlds: the real world, and the world that replaces their own eye color in the real world with another color. Then after the foreigner made the announcement, the world that everyone has brown eyes (0000) is not possible (which is the common knowledge), therefore the Kripke model in <strong>Day 0</strong> will be Fig.2. On the <strong>Day 1 </strong>(Fig.3) , no one suicides, because each blue-eyed person is waiting for the other one to suicide. On the <strong>Day 2 </strong>(Fig.4), the blue-eyed people both realize that they have blue eyes, and they both commit suicide.

<font size=6>Mesa model</font>
- The model is implemented in Python with the help of *mesa* and *pygraphviz*. Mesa is a multi-agent simulation module that helps with creating and running agents and environments. It allows stepwise updates of the agents' knowledge and collects data which are presened below. Pygraphviz is used to represent the Kripke model and perform updates on the graph.
