Based on the significantly different results of the three situations, we can see the puzzle with one color-blinded person illustrates the importance of common knowledge and public announcements in coordination problems. Moreover, the foreigner’s announcement creates common knowledge among the islanders that at least one of them has blue eyes, but it does not create common knowledge among the islanders that they all have the same perception of eye colors. This leads to a difference between the islanders’ beliefs and reality, which prevents them from the suicide in some cases.
