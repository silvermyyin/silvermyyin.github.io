Based on the significantly different results of the three situations, we can see the puzzle with one color-blinded person illustrates the importance of common knowledge and public announcements in coordination problems. Moreover, the foreigner’s announcement creates common knowledge among the islanders that at least one of them has blue eyes, but it does not create common knowledge among the islanders that they all have the same perception of eye colors. This leads to a difference between the islanders’ beliefs and reality, which prevents them from the suicide in some cases.

Overall, we can get the result of our variation that if there are more than one blue-eyed people (suppose the total number is **m**), all the normal blue-eyed people (**m-1**) will suicide at **Day m**, the color-blinded one will suicide the next day. If there is only one blue-eyed people who is exactly the color-blinded one, then all the brown-eyed people will suicide at **Day 2**, the color-blinded one will suicide the next day. If the color-blinded person is brown-eyed, the situation will be as the normal one.

For future work, we could look into more variations such as what happens if one member of the tribe has dementia and forgets everything he knows at
the beginning of each day? What happens if someone mishears the announcement and thinks there is someone with green eyes ?
