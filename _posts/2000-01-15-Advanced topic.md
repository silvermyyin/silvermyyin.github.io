- **Public announcement logic** : Our puzzle is connected to public announcement logic because it involves a situation where the knowledge of the agents changes after a public announcement is made. When the foreigner says that he sees a person with blue eyes, this changes the knowledge and beliefs of the islanders. That is to say, the foreigner's statement that at least one person from the tribe has blue eyes is a public announcement that eliminates the possible world where no one has blue eyes. This announcement triggers a chain of reasoning among the tribe members that leads them to discover their own eye color eventually. 

- **Common knowledge** : After the foreigner’s statement, it becomes common knowledge among the islanders that there is at least one person with blue eyes on the island. Therefore, this puzzle is a common knowledge logic puzzle because it involves the notion of common knowledge. Common knowledge can be formalized using multi-modal logic systems with epistemic operators. This common knowledge triggers a chain of reasoning that depends on the number of blue-eyed islanders and their individual knowledge. Without common knowledge, the puzzle cannot be solved.
