- *Public announcement logic* : Our puzzle is connected to public announcement logic because it involves a situation where the knowledge of the agents changes after a public announcement is made. When the foreigner says that he sees a person with blue eyes, this changes the knowledge and beliefs of the islanders. That is to say, the foreigner's statement that at least one person from the tribe has blue eyes is a public announcement that eliminates the possible world where no one has blue eyes. This announcement triggers a chain of reasoning among the tribe members that leads them to discover their own eye color eventually. Public announcement logic can formalize and analyze the puzzle by using modal operators that express what the agents know before and after the announcement, and how their knowledge changes over time.
- *Common knowledge* : After the foreignerâ€™s statement, it becomes common knowledge among the islanders that there is at least one person with blue eyes on the island. Therefore, this puzzle is a common knowledge logic puzzle because it involves the notion of common knowledge, which is a special kind of knowledge for a group of agents. Common knowledge of p in a group of agents G means that all the agents in G know p, they all know that they know p, they all know that they all know that they know p, and so on ad infinitum1. Common knowledge can be formalized using multi-modal logic systems with epistemic operators. This common knowledge triggers a chain of reasoning that depends on the number of blue-eyed islanders and their individual knowledge. Without common knowledge, the puzzle cannot be solved.
