title: <font size=10 color=lightblue>II. Basic arguments and possible variations</font>
---
The main research question is based on two possible arguments
- Argument 1: The foreigner has no effect, because his comments do not tell the tribe anything that they do not already know.
- Argument 2: 100 days after the address, all the blue eyed people leave the island.

<font size=6>Variations</font>
- What happens if one member of the tribe is deaf and cannot hear the public announcement?
Does their eye color matter?
- What happens if one member of the tribe has dementia and forgets everything he knows at
the beginning of each day?
- What happens if someone mishears the announcement and thinks there is someone with green
eyes?
- It is common knowledge that any islander who knows for certain (barring any unpredictable events including new outsider knowledge) what day they will leave, must announce it the following day, and tell everyone else what day theyâ€™re leaving.
